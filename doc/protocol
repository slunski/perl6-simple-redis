Redis use simple client-server protocol - request/response is just set
of text lines (UTF-8 aware) finsihed with "\r\n". This make Redis
lightweight and efective as cache for sessions, memoization, etc - and
that all with data persistence (on disk) build in. Becouse of such protocol
real work is done in 'server' part so using Redis on busy WWW frontends
is Good Thing - both for frontends and DB backends (assuming load is what
DB backends like).
