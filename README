Simple::Redis is pure Perl 6 module for using Redis key-value store
(http://redis.io). Except key/value pairs Redis allows to use
many interesting data structures like hashes, lists, sets and sorted
sets. Additionally features like transactions, commands queue,
publish/subscribe mode and replication are all build in. This allow
to classify Redis as "rich NoSQL" database. And last but not least -
Redis performance is very high: it can execute 100k rw ops/sec.

Redis use simple client-server protocol - request/response is just set
of text lines (UTF-8 aware) finsihed with "\r\n". This make Redis
lightweight and efective as cache for sessions, memoization, etc - and
that all with data persistence (on disk) build in. Becouse of such protocol
real work is done in 'server' part so using Redis on busy WWW frontends is
Good Thing - both for frontends and DB backends.


INSTALL

Simple::Redis module do not have any special dependencies except
Perl 6 environment. For installation (cloning) source code repository
git VCS is required. Redis itself can be installed by:

	apt-get install redis-server

on Debian boxes. Actually (2011/10) Redis v2.4 is in Debian 'experimental'
repository.

Simple::Redis package installation steps are:

	cd where/you/want/sources
	git clone https://github.com/slunski/perl6-simple-redis.git

then use Perl6 'ufo' tool to get Makefile:

	ufo
	make
	make test
	# TODO #make install  # use 'panda' ?


TODO

Simple::Redis is young project and still under heav development. At
the moment all commands for normal - db-like-usage - are implemented.
Missing commands are mainly responsible for remote Redis administration.
List of things still missing can be found in TODO file.
