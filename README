Simple::Redis is pure Perl 6 module for using Redis key-value store
(http://redis.io) Except storing key/value pairs it allow to store
many interesting data structures like hashes, lists, sets. Additionally
such features like transactions, commands queue, publish/subscribe moda
and replication are all build in. This allow to classify Redis as
"rich NoSQL" database. And last but not least - Redis performance is
very high: it can execute even 100 000 updates/sec.

Redis use simple client-server protocol - just set of text lines
(UTF-8 aware) finsihed with "\r\n" - what make it lightweight and
efective as cache for sessions, memoization, etc. - and that with
data persistence (on disk) build in.
