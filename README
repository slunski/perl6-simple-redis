Simple::Redis is pure Perl6 module for using Redis key-value store
(http://redis.io). Except key/value pairs Redis allows to use
many interesting data structures like hashes, lists, sets and sorted
sets. Additionally features like transactions, commands queue,
publish/subscribe mode and replication are build in. This allow
to classify Redis as "rich NoSQL" database. And last but not least -
Redis performance is very high.

Redis v2.4 is supported atm.
