Simple::Redis is pure Perl 6 module for using Redis key-value store
(http://redis.io) Except storing key/value pairs it allow to store
many interesting data structures like hashes, lists and sets.
Additionally such features like transactions, commands queue,
publish/subscribe moda and replication are all build in. This allow
to classify Redis as "rich NoSQL" database. And last but not least -
Redis performance is very high: it can execute even 100k updates/sec.

Redis use simple client-server protocol - request/response is just set
of text lines (UTF-8 aware) finsihed with "\r\n". This make Redis
lightweight and efective as cache for sessions, memoization, etc. - and
that all with data persistence (on disk) build in.


INSTALL

Simple::Redis module do not have any special dependencies except
Perl 6 environment. For installation (cloning) source code repository
git VCS is required. Redis itself can be installed by:

	apt-get install redis-server

on Debian boxes. Module installation steps are:

	cd where/you/want/sources
	git clone https://github.com/slunski/perl6-simple-redis.git

then use Perl6 'ufo' tool to get Makefile:

	ufo
	make
	make test


TODO

Simple::Redis is very young project and still under heav development. At
the moment all commands for normal - db-like-usage - are implemented,
however more testing is required. Missing commands are mainly responsible
for remote Redis administration. List of things to be done can be found in
TODO file.
