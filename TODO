Dev work:
* Write commands for:
 - pub/sub
 - configuration management
 - debugging
* Testing
* Profiling on stable Perl6 implementation. Little (easy part) already done :)

LHF:
* lc command names in command hash
* Few commands use old syntax disallowing variable param number;
  Migration to v2.4 syntax needed
* Test AUTH command

Other:
* Extract commands which needs special threatment ?
* Non-blocking API ?
* Documentation
* Examples
