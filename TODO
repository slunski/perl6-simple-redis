Dev work:
* Write commands for:
 - pub/sub
 - configuration management
 - debugging
* Testing
* Profiling on stable Perl6 implementation :)

LHF:
* lc command names in command hash
* few commands use old syntax disallowing variable params;
  Migration to v2.4 syntax needed
* test AUTH command

Other:
* Extract commands which needs special threatment ?
* make multi-bulk parsing use bulk parsing + pipelining ?
* split command sending and reply parsing ?
* Non-blocking API ?
* Documentation
* Examples
