Dev work:
* Write commands for:
 - remote administration (few is missing)
 - pub/sub
 - scripting
* Testing
* Profiling on more Perl6 implementations

LHF:
* lc command names in command hash
* Few commands use old syntax disallowing variable param number;
  Migration to v2.4 syntax needed
* Test AUTH command

Other:
* Extract commands which needs special threatment (?)
* Non-blocking API (?) S::R::PubSub should use it
* Documentation
* Examples
